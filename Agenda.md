## Jan 16

- **Today**
  - [ ] Characteristics of JavaScript
    - case-sensitive
    - **not** a type-safe language
    - looks a lot like C#, but has a number of differences
    - string literals can be wrapped in double or single quotes
    - string interpolation is performed with text inside a pair of back-ticks (`` ` ``)
      - placeholders in the form of `${expression}`
      - e.g.: `` `The count is ${count}` ``
  - [ ] ***Variables***
  - [ ] The browser's dev tools provides a **console** that is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) environment for JavaScript
  - [ ] Node also provides/is a REPL for JavaScript
  - [ ] **Demo:** Combine the main points of [003](./src/003/ReadMe.md) and [004](./src/004/ReadMe.md)
